## Print can be augmented with \n for line breaks - as with JS

print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!")

## Concatenation is the same as JavaScript really.

print("Hello " + "James")

## Printing can also directly print the result of an input as below (Use vars instead though, obvs).

print(input("What's your name?"))
